<h3 class="major">Project Overview</h3>
<p>
Ashton the Turtleduck is an electromechanical project designed to demonstrate how
electrical conductivity in ionized water can be used to activate a circuit.
The system combines mechanical design, electrical theory, and experimental validation.
</p>

<h3 class="major">Objective</h3>
<p>
Design a floating electromechanical device that activates when placed in ionized water,
demonstrating principles of resistance, current flow, buoyancy, and energy conversion.
</p>

<h3 class="major">Mechanical & Electrical Design</h3>
<p>
The Turtleduck body was 3D printed and sealed to prevent water ingress.
Special attention was given to buoyancy, weight distribution, and motor protrusion.
Aluminum electrodes were used to avoid oxidation issues encountered with copper.
</p>

<h3 class="major">Circuit Logic & Theory</h3>
<p>
Salt added to the water lowers resistance, allowing current to flow and complete the circuit.
Using Ohm’s Law (V = IR), the increase in current enables the motor to activate.
The water effectively behaves as a conductive path rather than an insulator.

<h3 class="major">Testing & Experimental Results</h3>
<p>
Efficiency testing was performed using a hanging mass experiment.
Electrical energy was converted into kinetic and then potential energy.
Measured voltage, current, mass, and time values were used to estimate system efficiency.
</p>

<div class="experiment-section">

  <h3 class="major">Experimental Energy Breakdown</h3>

  <p>
    The Turtleduck system converts electrical energy into mechanical motion
    through a conductive water path. Measurements were taken to estimate
    energy transfer efficiency across electrical, kinetic, and potential stages.

<h3 class="major">Engineering Challenges</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Water sealing significantly increased mechanical complexity</li>
  <li>Friction and sealing reduced overall efficiency</li>
  <li>Accurate experimental measurements were difficult to repeat consistently</li>
  <li>Simple designs can hide complex interdisciplinary challenges</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="major">Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>
This project reinforced the importance of interdisciplinary thinking.
Electrical theory, mechanical constraints, and experimental uncertainty
must be addressed simultaneously to achieve reliable real-world behavior.
</p>


<h3 class="major">Future Improvements</h3>
<p>
Future iterations would include a replaceable battery system,
alternative sealing methods, and improved experimental measurement techniques.
